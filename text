Road Safety Index (RSI) is a program based on a machine learning algorithm that predicts how vulnerable is a road to accidents. It is trained in a way that it predicts the vulnerability using a 'training dataset' consisting of 500(regularly increases as the survey grows) images from India and their scores for vulnerability obtained from survey. It differentiates images with the help of various image features (or attributes), which represent the image's textures, colors and shapes. To predict the vulnerability of a new image, RSI decomposes this image into features and assign the image a score based on the associations between features and scores learned from the training dataset.
